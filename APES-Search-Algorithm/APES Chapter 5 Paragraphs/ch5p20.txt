Humans have long influenced evolution by breeding  plants and animals for desirable traits. For example, all  breeds of domesticated dogs belong to the same species  as the gray wolf (Canis lupus), yet dogs exist in an amazing variety of sizes and shapes, ranging from toy poodles  to Siberian huskies. Beginning with the domestication of wolves, dog breeders have selectively bred individuals that had particular  qualities they desired, including body size, body shape,  and coat color. After many generations of breeding, the  selected traits became more and more exaggerated until  breeders felt satisfied that the desired characteristics of a  new dog breed had been achieved. As a result of this  carefully controlled breeding, we have a tremendous  variety of dog sizes, shapes, and colors today. Yet dogs  remain a single species: All dog breeds can still mate with  one another and produce viable offspring.
