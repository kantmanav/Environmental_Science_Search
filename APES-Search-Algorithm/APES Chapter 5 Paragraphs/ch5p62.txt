Throughout Earthâ€™s history, individual species have  evolved and gone extinct at random intervals. The fossil record has revealed five periods of global mass  extinction, in which large numbers of species went  extinct over relatively short periods of time. Note that because species are not always easy to discriminate in the fossil record, scientists count the number of genera, rather than species, that once roamed  Earth but are now extinct.
