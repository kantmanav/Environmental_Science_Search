Genetic drift is a change in the genetic composition of  a population over time as a result of random mating. Like  mutation and gene flow, genetic drift is a nonadaptive,  random process. It can have a particularly important role  in altering the genetic composition of small populations. In small populations, random mating among individuals can  eliminate some of the rare individuals simply because  they did not find a mate in a given year. For example,  imagine a small population of five animals, in which two  individuals carry genes that produce black hair and three  individuals carry genes that produce white hair. If, by  chance, the individuals that carry the genes for black  hair fail to find a mate, those genes will not be passed on.  The next generation will be entirely white-haired, and  the black-haired phenotype will be lost. In this case, the  genetic composition of the population has changed, and  the population has therefore evolved. The cause underlying this evolution is random; the failure to find a mate  has nothing to do with hair color. In contrast, a large  population that has the same proportion of black-haired  mice, has a greater absolute  number of mice. As a result, it is less likely that random  mating events will cause all of the black-haired mice to  not find a mate, so their genes are passed on to the next  generation and genetic drift is less likely to occur.
