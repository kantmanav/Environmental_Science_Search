Earth’s biodiversity is the product of evolution,  which can be defined as a change in the genetic composition of a population over time. Evolution can  occur at multiple levels. Evolution below the species  level, such as the evolution of different varieties of  apples or potatoes, is called microevolution. In contrast, when genetic changes give rise to new species, or  to new genera, families, classes, or phyla—larger categories of organisms into which species are organized—  we call the process macroevolution. Among these  many levels of macroevolution, the term speciation is  restricted to the evolution of new species.
