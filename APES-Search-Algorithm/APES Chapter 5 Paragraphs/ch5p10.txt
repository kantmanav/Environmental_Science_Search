The relatedness of the species in a phylogeny is  determined by similarity of traits: The more similar the  traits of two species, the more closely related the two  species are assumed to be. Historically, scientists used  mostly morphological traits, including a large number  of bone measurements, to measure similarity. Today,  scientists base phylogenies on a variety of characteristics, including morphology, behavior, and genetics.
