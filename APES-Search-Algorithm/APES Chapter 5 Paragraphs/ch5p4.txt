The insects represent a group that contains more species than most other groups, so scientists reason that if  we could get a good estimate for the number of insect  species in the world, we would have a much better  sense of the total number of species. In one study,  researchers fumigated the canopies of a single tree species in the tropical rainforest and then collected all the  dead insects that fell from the trees onto a tarp on the  ground. From this collection of dead insects, they  counted the number of beetle species that fed on only  the one tree species they fumigated. By multiplying this  number of beetle species by the total number of tropical  tree species, they estimated that in the tropics there  were perhaps 8 million species of beetles that feed on a  single species of tree. Because beetles make up about 40  percent of all insect species, and because insect species in  the forest canopy tend to be about twice as numerous as  insect species on the forest floor, the researchers suggested that a reasonable estimate for the total number of  tropical insect species might be 30 million. More recent  work has indicated that this number is probably too  high. Current estimates for the total number of species  on Earth range between 5 million and 100 million, but  most scientists estimate that there are about 10 million  species.
