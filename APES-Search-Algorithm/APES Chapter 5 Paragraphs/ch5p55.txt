In much of northern North America, lakes formed  12,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age when  temperatures warmed and the glaciers slowly retreated  to the north. The retreating glaciers left behind a great  deal of barren land, which was quickly colonized by  plants, including trees. Some of the pollen produced  by these trees fell into lakes and was buried in the lake  sediments. Scientists can measure the ages of these  sediment layers with carbon dating. Furthermore, because each tree species has uniquely  shaped pollen, it is possible to determine when a particular tree species arrived near a particular lake and  how the entire community of plant species changed  over time. These pollen records  suggest that changes in climatic conditions after the ice  age produced substantial changes in the distributions of  plants over time. Pine trees, spruce trees, and birch  trees all moved north with the retreat of the glaciers.  As the plants moved north, the animals followed.
