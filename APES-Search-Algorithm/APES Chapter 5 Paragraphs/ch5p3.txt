The number of species in any given place is the  most common measure of biodiversity, but estimating  the total number of species on Earth is a challenge.  Many species are easy to find, such as the birds or small  mammals you might see in your neighborhood.  Others are not so easy to find. Some species are active  only at night, live in inaccessible locations such as the  deep ocean, or cannot be seen without a microscope.  To date, scientists have named approximately 2 million species, which means the total must be larger than  that.
