In some cases, an individual’s phenotype is determined almost entirely by genes. For instance, a person  who inherits the genes for brown eyes will have  brown eyes, regardless of where that person lives.  Most phenotypes, however, are the product of an  individual’s environment as well as its genotype. For  example, in many turtle and crocodile species, the  temperature of eggs during incubation determines  whether the offspring will hatch as males or females.  The water flea, a tiny animal that lives in ponds and  lakes, offers another interesting example. The body  shape of the water flea depends on whether or not a young individual smells predators in its environment  (FIGURE 15.1). If predators are absent, the water flea  develops a relatively small head and tail spine. If  predators are present, however, the water flea develops a much larger head and a long tail spine. Although  the larger head and longer tail spine help prevent the  water flea from being eaten, they come at the cost of  slower reproduction. Therefore, it is beneficial that  the water flea not produce these defenses unless they  are needed. By being able to respond to changing  environmental conditions, organisms such as the  water flea can improve their ability to survive and  reproduce in any environment.
