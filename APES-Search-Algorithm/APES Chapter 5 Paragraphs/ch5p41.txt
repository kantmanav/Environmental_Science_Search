If the two separated habitats differ in environmental  conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, or the  occurrence of predators, natural selection will favor different phenotypes in each of the habitats. If individuals  cannot move between the populations, then over time  the two geographically isolated populations will continue  to become more and more genetically distinct. Eventually,  the two populations will be separated not only by geographic isolation but also by reproductive isolation,  which means the two populations of a species have  evolved separately to the point that they can no longer  interbreed and produce viable offspring. At this point,  the two populations will have become distinct species.
