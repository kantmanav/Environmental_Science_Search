We can begin with parents producing offspring that vary in their body size. The largest offspring are consumed by fish because fish prefer  to eat large prey rather than small prey. As a result, the  smaller offspring are left to reproduce. Because body size is, in part, determined by an individualâ€™s genes, the  next generation of amphipods will be smaller. This  process can continue over many generations and over  time the fish will cause the evolution of smaller body  sizes in amphipods.
