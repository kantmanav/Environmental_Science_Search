A short walk through the woods, a corner lot, or a city  park makes one thing clear: Life comes in many forms.  A small plot of untended land or a tiny pond contains  dozens, perhaps hundreds, of different kinds of plants  and animals visible to the naked eye as well as  thousands of different kinds of microscopic organisms.  In contrast, a carefully tended lawn or a commercial  timber plantation usually supports only a few types of  grasses or trees. The total number of  organisms in the plantation or lawn may be the same  as the number in the pond or in the untended plot, but  the number of species will be far smaller.
