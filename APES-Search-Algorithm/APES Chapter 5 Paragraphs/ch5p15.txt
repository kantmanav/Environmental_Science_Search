DNA is copied millions of times during an organismâ€™s  lifetime as cells grow and divide. An occasional mistake in the copying process produces a random change  in the genetic code, which is known as a mutation.  Environmental factors, such as ultraviolet radiation  from the Sun, can also cause mutations. When mutations occur in cells responsible for reproduction, such  as the eggs and sperm of animals, those mutations can  be passed on to the next generation.
