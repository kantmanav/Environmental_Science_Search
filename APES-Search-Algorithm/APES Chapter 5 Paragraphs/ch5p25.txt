Of the two scientists, Charles Darwin is perhaps the  better known. At age 22, he became the naturalist on  board HMS Beagle, a British survey ship that sailed  around the world from 1831 to 1836. During his journey, Darwin made many observations of trait variation  across a tremendous variety of species. In addition to  observing living organisms, he found fossil evidence of a  large number of extinct species. He also recognized that  organisms produce many more offspring than are needed to replace the parents, and that most of these offspring  do not survive. Darwin questioned why, out of all the  species that had once existed on Earth, only a small fraction had survived. Similarly, he wondered why, among  all the offspring produced in a population in a given  year, only a small fraction survived to the next year.  During the decades following his voyage, he developed  his ideas into a robust theory. His On the Origin of Species  by Means of Natural Selection, published in 1859, changed  the way people thought about the natural world.
