Sometimes evolution can occur rapidly, as in the case  of the cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika, one of the  African Great Lakes. Evidence indicates that the  roughly 200 different species of cichlids in the lake  evolved from a single ancestral species over a period of  several million years. During this period, some cichlid  species specialized to become insect eaters and others  to become fish eaters, while still others evolved to eat  invertebrates such as snails and clams.
