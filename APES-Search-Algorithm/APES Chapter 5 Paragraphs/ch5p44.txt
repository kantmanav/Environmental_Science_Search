The key feature of polyploid organisms is that once  they become polyploid, they generally cannot interbreed with their diploid ancestors. At the instant polyploidy occurs, the polyploid and diploid organisms are  reproductively isolated from each other and are therefore distinct species, even though they may continue  to live in the same place.
