Species vary in their ability to move physically across the landscape as the environment  changes. Some species are highly mobile at  particular life stages: Adult birds and winddispersed seeds, for example, move across the  landscape easily. Other organisms, such as the  desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii), are slow  movers. Furthermore, the movements of  many species may be impeded by obstacles  built by humans, including roads and dams. It  remains unclear how species that face these  challenges will shift their distributions as  global climate change occurs.
