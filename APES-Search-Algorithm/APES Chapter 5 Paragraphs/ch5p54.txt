Because species are adapted to particular environmental  conditions, we would expect that changes in environmental conditions would alter the distribution of species on Earth. For example, scientists have found evidence  for the relationship between environmental change and  species distribution in layers of sediments that have accumulated over time at the bottom of modern lakes. Each  sediment layer contains pollen from plants that lived in  the region when the sediments were deposited. In some  cases, this pollen record goes back thousands of years.
