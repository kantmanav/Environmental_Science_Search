Gene flow is the process by which individuals move  from one population to another and thereby alter the  genetic composition of both populations. Populations can experience an influx of migrating individuals with  different alleles. The arrival of these individuals from  adjacent populations alters the frequency of alleles in  the population. High gene flow between two populations can cause the two populations to become very  similar in genetic composition. In a population that is  experiencing natural or artificial selection, high gene  flow from outside can prevent the population from  responding to selection.
