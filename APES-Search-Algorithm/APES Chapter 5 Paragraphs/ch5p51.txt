Every species has an optimal environment in which it  performs particularly well. All species have a range of  tolerance, or limits to the abiotic conditions they can  tolerate, such as extremes of temperature, humidity,  salinity, and pH. As  conditions move further away from the ideal, individuals may be able to survive, and perhaps even to  grow, but not be able to reproduce. As conditions  continue to move away from the ideal, individuals  can only survive. If conditions move beyond the  range of tolerance, individuals will die. Because the  combination of abiotic conditions in a particular environment fundamentally determines whether a species  can persist there, the suite of abiotic conditions under which a species can survive, grow, and reproduce is  the fundamental niche of the species.
