Genetic diversity can also be created through recombination.  In plants and animals, genetic recombination occurs as  chromosomes are duplicated during reproductive cell  division and a piece of one chromosome breaks off and  attaches to another chromosome. This process does not  create new genes, but it does bring together new combinations of alleles on a chromosome and can therefore  produce novel traits. For example, the human immune  system must battle a large variety of viruses and bacteria  that regularly attempt to invade the body. Recombination  allows new allele combinations to come together, and  this provides new immune defenses that may prove to be  effective against the invading organisms.
