The ability of a species to survive an environmental  change depends greatly on how quickly it evolves the adaptations needed to thrive and reproduce under the  new conditions. If a species cannot adapt quickly  enough, it will go extinct. This can happen when the  rate of environmental change is faster than the rate at  which evolution can respond. Slow rates of evolution  can occur when a population has long generation times  or when a population contains low genetic variation on  which natural selection can act.
