Recall from Chapter 1 that a species is defined as a  group of organisms that is distinct from other such groups in terms of size, shape, behavior, or biochemical properties, and that can interbreed with other individuals in its group to produce viable offspring. This  last requirement is important because sometimes individuals from different species can mate, but they do  not produce offspring that survive.
