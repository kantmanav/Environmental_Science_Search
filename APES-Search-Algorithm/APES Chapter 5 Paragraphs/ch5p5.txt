Because species are not uniformly distributed, the number of species on Earth is not a useful indicator of how  many species live in a particular location. Often we  desire to know the number of species at a given location  to determine whether a region is being affected by human activities. To measure species diversity at local  or regional scales, scientists have developed two measures: species richness and species evenness.
