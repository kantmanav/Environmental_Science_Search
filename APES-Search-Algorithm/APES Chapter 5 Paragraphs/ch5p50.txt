Evolution occurs even more rapidly in populations of  genetically modified organisms. Using genetic engineering  techniques, scientists can now copy genes from a species  with some desirable trait, such as rapid growth or disease  resistance. Scientists can insert these genes into other  species of plants, animals, or microbes to produce  genetically modified organisms (GMO). When  those organisms reproduce, they pass on the inserted  genes to their offspring. For example, scientists have  found that a soil bacterium (Bacillus thuringiensis) naturally produces an insecticide as a defense against being  consumed by insects in the soil. Plant breeders have  identified the bacterial genes that are responsible for  making the insecticide, copied those genes, and inserted  them into the genomes of crop plants. Such crops can  now naturally produce their own insecticide, which  makes them less attractive to insect herbivores. Common  examples include Bt-corn and Bt-cotton, so named  because they contain genes from soil bacterium. As you  might guess, inserting genes into an organism is a much  faster way to produce desired traits than traditional plant  and animal breeding, which can only select from the  naturally available variation in a population.
