Allopatric speciation is thought to be responsible for  the diversity of the group of birds known as Darwin’s  finches. When Charles Darwin visited the Galápagos  Islands, located just west of Ecuador, he noted a large  variety of finch species, each of which seemed to live  in different habitats or to eat different foods. Research  on these birds has demonstrated that they all share a  common ancestor that colonized the islands from the  mainland long ago. Over a few million years, as Darwin  discovered, the finches that were geographically isolated on different islands became genetically distinct  and eventually became reproductively isolated.
