The pace of evolution by artificial selection can be  incredibly fast. Such rapid evolution is occurring in  many species of commercially harvested fish, including  the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Intensive fishing over  several decades has targeted the largest adults, selectively  removing most of those individuals from the population  and, therefore, also removing the genes that produce  large adults. Because larger fish tend to reach sexual  maturity later, the genes that code for a later onset of  sexual maturity have also been removed. As a result,  after just a few decades of intensive fishing, the Atlantic  cod population has evolved to reach reproductive maturity at a smaller size and a younger age. This evolution  of shorter generation times also means that the cod may  be able to evolve even faster in the future.
