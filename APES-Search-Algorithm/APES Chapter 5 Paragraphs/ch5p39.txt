Microevolution is happening all around us, from the  breeding of agricultural crops, to the unintentional  evolution of drug-resistant bacteria in hospitals, to the  bottleneck that reduced genetic variation in the cheetah. But how do we move from the evolution of  genetically distinct populations of a species to the evolution of genetically distinct species? That is, how do  we move from microevolution to macroevolution?  Two common processes are allopatric speciation and  sympatric speciation.
