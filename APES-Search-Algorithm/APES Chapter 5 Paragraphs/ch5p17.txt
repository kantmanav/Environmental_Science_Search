Sometimes a mutation improves an organism’s  chances of survival or reproduction. If such a mutation  is passed along to the next generation, it adds new  genetic diversity to the population. Some mosquitoes,  for example, possess a mutation that makes them less  vulnerable to insecticides. In areas that are sprayed  with insecticides, this mutation improves an individual  mosquito’s chance of surviving and reproducing.
