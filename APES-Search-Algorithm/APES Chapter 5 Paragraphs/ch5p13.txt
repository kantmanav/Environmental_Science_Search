An individual’s genotype serves as the blueprint for the  complete set of traits that organism may potentially possess. An individual’s phenotype is the actual set of traits  expressed in that individual. Among these traits are the  individual’s anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The  color of your eyes, for example, is your phenotype,  whereas the genes that code for eye color are a part of  your genotype. Changes in genotypes can produce  important changes in phenotypes.
