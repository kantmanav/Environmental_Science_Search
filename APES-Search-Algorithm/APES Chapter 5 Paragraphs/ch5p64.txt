A better-known mass extinction occurred at the end  of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), when  roughly one-half of Earthâ€™s species, including the dinosaurs, went extinct. The cause of this mass extinction  has been the subject of great debate, but there is now  a near-consensus that a large meteorite struck Earth  and produced a dust cloud that circled the planet and  blocked incoming solar radiation. This resulted in an  almost complete halt to photosynthesis, and thus an  almost total lack of food at the bottom of the food  chain. Among the few species that survived was a small  squirrel-sized primate that was the ancestor of humans.
