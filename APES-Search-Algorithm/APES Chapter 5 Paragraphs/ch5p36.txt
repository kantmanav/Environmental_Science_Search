Low genetic variation in a population can cause several problems, including increased risk of disease and  low fertility. In addition, species that have been through  a population bottleneck are often less able to adapt to  future changes in their environment. In some cases,  once a species has been forced through a bottleneck, the resulting low genetic diversity causes it to decline to  extinction, which occurs when the last member of a  species dies. Such declines are thought to be occurring  in a number of species today. The cheetah, for example,  has relatively little genetic variation due to a bottleneck  that appears to have occurred 10,000 years ago.
