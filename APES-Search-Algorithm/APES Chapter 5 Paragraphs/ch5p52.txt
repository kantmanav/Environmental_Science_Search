The fundamental niche establishes the abiotic  limits for the persistence of a species. However,  biotic factors can further limit the locations where a  species can live. Common biotic limitations include  the presence of competitors, predators, and diseases.  For example, even if abiotic conditions are favorable  for a plant species in a particular location, other  plant species may be better competitors for water  and soil nutrients. Those competitors might prevent  the species from growing in that environment.  Similarly, even if a small rodent can tolerate the  temperature and humidity of a tropical forest, a  deadly rodent disease might prevent the species  from persisting in the forest. Therefore, biotic factors further narrow the fundamental niche that a  species actually uses. The range of abiotic and biotic  conditions under which a species actually lives is  called its realized niche. Once we determine what  contributes to the realized niche of a species, we  have a better understanding of the distribution of  the species, or the areas of the world in which the  species lives.
