One common way in which evolution creates new species is through geographic isolation, which means  the physical separation of a group of individuals from  others of the same species. The process of speciation  that occurs with geographic isolation is known as  allopatric speciation (from the Greek allos, meaning  “other,” and patris, meaning “fatherland”). Geographic isolation can occur when a  subset of individuals from a larger population colonizes  a new area of habitat that is physically separated from  that larger population. For example, a single large population of field mice might be split into two smaller  populations as geographic barriers change over time.  For example, a river might change course and divide a large prairie into two halves, a large lake might split into  two smaller lakes, or a new mountain range could rise.  In such cases, the genetic composition of the isolated  populations might diverge over time, either because of  random processes or because natural selection favors different adaptations on each side of the barrier.
