The key ideas of Darwin’s theory of evolution by  natural selection are the following:  • Individuals produce an excess of offspring.  • Not all offspring can survive.  • Individuals differ in their traits.  • Differences in traits can be passed on from  parents to offspring.  • Differences in traits are associated with  differences in the ability to survive and  reproduce.
