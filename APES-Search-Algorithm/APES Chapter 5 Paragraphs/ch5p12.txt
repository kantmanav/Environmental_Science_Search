To understand how genetic diversity is created,  we first need to understand genes. Genes are physical locations on chromosomes within each cell of an  organism. A given gene has DNA that codes for a  particular trait, such as body size, but the DNA can  take different forms known as alleles. An organismâ€™s  genes determine the range of possible traits (physical  or behavioral characteristics) that it can pass down  to its offspring. The complete set of genes in an  individual is called its genotype. In this section, we  will discuss how genotypes help to determine the  traits of individuals and the two processes that can  create genetic diversity in a population: mutation and  recombination.
