Evolution also takes place through natural mechanisms. In evolution by natural selection, the environment determines which individuals survive and  reproduce. Members of a population naturally vary in  their traits, and certain combinations of those traits  make individuals better able to survive and reproduce.  As a result, the genes that produce those traits are more  common in the next generation.
