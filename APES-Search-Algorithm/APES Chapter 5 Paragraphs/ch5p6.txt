The number of species in a given area, such as a  pond, the canopy of a tree, or a plot of grassland, is  known as species richness. Species richness is used  to give an approximate sense of the biodiversity of a  particular place. However, we may also want to know  the species evenness, which is the relative proportion of individuals within the different species in a  location. Species evenness tells us whether a particular  ecosystem is numerically dominated by one species or  whether all of its species have similar abundances. An  ecosystem has high species evenness if its species are  all represented by similar numbers of individuals. An  ecosystem has low species evenness if one species is  represented by many individuals whereas other species are represented by only a few individuals. In this  case, there is effectively less diversity.
