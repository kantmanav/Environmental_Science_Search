Artificial and natural selection are important mechanisms of evolution, but evolution can also occur by  random, or nonadaptive, processes. In these cases, the  genetic composition of a population changes over  time, but the changes are not related to differences in  fitness among individuals. There are five random processes: mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, bottleneck effects,  and founder effects.
