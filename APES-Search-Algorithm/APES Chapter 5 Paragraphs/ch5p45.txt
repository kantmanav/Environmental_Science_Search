How long does evolution take? A significant change  in a speciesâ€™ genotype and phenotype, such as an  adaptation to a completely different food source, can  take anywhere from hundreds to millions of years. In  this section, we will consider examples of rapid evolution by natural selection and very rapid evolution by  artificial selection.
