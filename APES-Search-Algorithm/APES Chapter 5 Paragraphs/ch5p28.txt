Both artificial and natural selection begin with the  requirement that individuals vary in their traits and  that these variations are capable of being passed on to  the next generation. In both cases, parents produce  more offspring than necessary to replace themselves,  and some of these offspring either do not survive or  do not reproduce. But in the case of artificial selection, humans decide which individuals will breed,  based on those individuals that possess the traits that  tend toward some predetermined goal, such as a curly  coat or large size. Natural selection does not select for  specific traits that tend toward some predetermined  goal. Rather, natural selection favors any combination of traits that improves an individual’s fitness—its  ability to survive and reproduce, as we saw in the case  of the smallest amphipods surviving predation by fish.  Traits that improve an individual’s fitness are called  adaptations.
