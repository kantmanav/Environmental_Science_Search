Natural selection can favor multiple solutions to a  particular environmental challenge, as long as each  solution improves an individualâ€™s ability to survive and  reproduce. For example, while all plants living in the  desert face the challenge of low water availability in  the soil, different species have evolved different solutions to this common challenge. Some species have  evolved large taproots to draw water from deep in the  soil. Other species have evolved the ability to store  excess water during infrequent rains. Still other species  have evolved waxy or hairy leaf surfaces that reduce  water loss. Each of these very different adaptations  allows the plants to survive and reproduce in a desert  environment.
