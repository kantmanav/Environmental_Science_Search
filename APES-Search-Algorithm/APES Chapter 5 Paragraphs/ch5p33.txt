Gene flow can be helpful in bringing in genetic  variation to a population that lacks it. For example,  the Florida panther is a subspecies of panther that  once roamed throughout much of the southeastern  United States and likely experienced gene flow with  other subspecies of panthers. By 1995, the Florida  panther only lived in southern Florida, occupying  only 5 percent of its original habitat. Moreover, the  number of panthers declined to only about 30 individuals, and because the Florida subspecies was isolated from other subspecies, it did not experience  gene flow. As a result, the  small population had low genetic variation and the  remaining individuals became very inbred. Being  inbred causes individuals to express homozygous,  harmful alleles. In the case of the panthers, these deleterious alleles caused a high prevalence of kinked  tails, heart defects, and low sperm counts. In response,  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service captured eight  panthers from the Texas subspecies and introduced  them to Florida with the hope that this gene flow would increase the genetic variation and allow the  population to grow. By 2011, the prevalence of  defects previously seen from inbreeding had declined  and the Florida panther population had increased to  160 individuals.
