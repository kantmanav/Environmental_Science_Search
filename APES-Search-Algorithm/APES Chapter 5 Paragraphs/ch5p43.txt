Allopatric speciation is thought to be the most common  way in which evolution generates new species. However,  it is not the only way. Sympatric speciation is the  evolution of one species into two species without geographic isolation. It usually happens through a process  known as polyploidy. Most organisms are diploid: They  have two sets of chromosomes. In polyploidy, the number of chromosomes increases to three, four, or even six  sets. Such increases can occur during the division of  reproductive cells, either accidentally in nature or as a  result of deliberate human actions. Plant breeders, for  example, have found several ways to interrupt the normal cell division process. Polyploid organisms include  some species of snails and salamanders, 15 percent of all flowering plant species, and a wide variety of agricultural crops such as bananas, strawberries, and wheat. Polyploidy often results in  larger plants and larger fruits.
