As useful as artificial selection has been to humans, it  can also produce a number of unintended results. For  example, farmers often use herbicides to kill weeds.  However, as we cover larger and larger areas with herbicides, there is an increasing chance that at least one  weed will possess a mutation that allows it to survive the  herbicide application. If that one mutant plant passes on  its herbicide resistance to its offspring, we will have  artificially selected for herbicide resistance in that weed.
