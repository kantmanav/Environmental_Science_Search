Most mutations are detrimental, and many cause the  offspring that carry them to die while they are  embryos. The effects of some mutations are less severe,  but can still be detrimental. For example, some dusky-headed conures (Aratinga weddellii) have a mutation  that makes these normally green-feathered parrots  produce feathers that appear to be blue.  In the wild, individuals with this mutation have a poor  chance of survival because blue feathers stand out  against the green vegetation and make them conspicuous to predators.
