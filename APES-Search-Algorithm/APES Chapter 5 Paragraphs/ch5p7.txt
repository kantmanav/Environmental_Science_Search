Scientists evaluating the biodiversity of an area  must often look at both species richness and species  evenness. Consider the two forest communities, community 1 and community 2, shown in.  Both forests contain 20 trees that are distributed  among four species. In community 1, each species is  represented by 5 individuals. In community 2, one  species is represented by 14 individuals and each of the  other three species is represented by 2 individuals.  Although the species richness of the two forests is  identical, the four species are more evenly represented  in community 1. That forest therefore has greater species evenness and is considered to be more diverse.
