A drastic reduction in the size of a population that  reduces genetic variation—known as a bottleneck  effect—is another random process that can change a  population’s genetic composition. A population might  experience a drastic reduction in its numbers for many  reasons, including habitat loss, a natural disaster, harvesting by humans, or changes in the environment. When the size of a  population is reduced, the amount of genetic variation  that can be present in the population is also reduced.  With fewer individuals there are fewer unique genotypes remaining in the population.
