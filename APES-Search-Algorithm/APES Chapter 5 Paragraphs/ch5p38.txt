We can see an example of the founder effect in the  Amish communities of Pennsylvania. The Amish  population was founded by a relatively small number  of individualsâ€”about 200 people from Germany. This  group happened to carry a mutation for Ellis-van  Creveld syndrome, a condition that causes a variety of malformations including extra fingers. The mutation is  rare in humans around the world, but by chance the  frequency of the mutation was higher in the early  Amish colonists and has remained higher because the  population is an isolated group with little gene flow  from outside its community.
