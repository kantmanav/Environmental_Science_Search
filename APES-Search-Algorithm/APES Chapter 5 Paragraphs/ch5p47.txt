Although the cichlids of Lake Tanganyika evolved  quickly in evolutionary terms, the pupfishes of the  Death Valley region of California and Nevada evolved  even more rapidly. In the 20,000 to 30,000 years since  the large lakes of the region were reduced to isolated  springs, several species of pupfish have evolved.
