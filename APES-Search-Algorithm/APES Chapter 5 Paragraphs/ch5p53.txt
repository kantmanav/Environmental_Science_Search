When we examine the realized niches of species in  nature, we see that some species, known as niche  generalists, can live under a very wide range of abiotic  or biotic conditions. For example, some insects, such as  the meadow spittlebug (Philaenus spumarius), feed on numerous plant species and can live in  different habitats. Other species, known as niche specialists, are specialized to live under a very narrow range  of conditions or feed on a small group of species. For  example, the skeletonizing leaf beetle (Trirhabda virgata) feeds on only a single species or genus of  plant. Niche specialists can persist quite well when environmental conditions remain relatively constant, but  they are more vulnerable to extinction if conditions  change because the loss of a favored habitat or food  source leaves them with few alternatives for survival. In  contrast, niche generalists should fare better under  changing conditions because they have a number of  alternative habitats and food sources available.
