Imagine that a few individuals of a particular bird species happen to be blown off their usual migration route  and land on a hospitable oceanic island. These two individuals will have been  drawn at random from the mainland population, and  the genotypes they possess are only a subset of those in  the original mainland population. These colonizing  individuals, or founders, will give rise to an island  population that has a genetic composition very different from that of the original mainland population. A  change in the genetic composition of a population as a  result of descending from a small number of colonizing  individuals is known as the founder effect. Like  mutation, genetic drift, and the bottleneck effect, the  founder effect is a random process that is not based on  differences in fitness.
