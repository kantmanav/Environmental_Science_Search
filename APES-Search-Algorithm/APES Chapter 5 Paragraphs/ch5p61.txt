Much of what we know about the evolution of life  is based on fossils, which are the remains of organisms  that have been preserved in rock. Most dead organisms decompose rapidly; the elements they contain  are recycled and nothing of the organism is preserved. Occasionally, though, organic material is  buried and protected from decomposition by mud or  other sediments. That material may eventually  become fossilized, which means it has been hardened  into rocklike material as it was buried under successive layers of sediment. When these  layers are uncovered, they reveal a record of at least  some of the organisms that existed at the time the  sediments were deposited. Because of the way layers  of sediment are deposited on top of one another over  time, the oldest fossilized organisms are found in the  deepest layers of the fossil record. We can therefore  use the fossil record to determine when different  species existed on Earth.
