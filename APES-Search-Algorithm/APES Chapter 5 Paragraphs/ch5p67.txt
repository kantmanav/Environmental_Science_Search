The recovery of biodiversity from earlier mass  extinctions took about 10 million years, an unthinkably long time from a human perspective. Recovery  from the present mass extinction could take just as  longâ€”500,000 human generations. Much of the current debate among environmental scientists and government officials centers on the true magnitude of this  crisis and on the costs of reducing the human impact  on extinction rates.
