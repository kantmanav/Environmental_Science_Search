During the last 2 decades, scientists have reached a  consensus that we are currently experiencing a sixth  global mass extinction of a magnitude within the  range of the previous five mass extinctions. Estimates  of extinction rates vary widely, ranging from 2 percent  to as many as 25 percent of species going extinct by  2020. However, in contrast to some previous mass  extinctions, there is agreement among scientists that  the current mass extinction has human causes. These  wide-ranging causes include habitat destruction,  overharvesting, introductions of invasive species,  climate change, and emerging diseases. Because much of the current environmental change  caused by human activities is both dramatic and  sudden, environmental scientists contend that many  species may not be able to move or adapt in time to  avoid extinction.
