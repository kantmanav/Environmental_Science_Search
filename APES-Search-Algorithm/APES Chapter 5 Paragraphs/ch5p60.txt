Even if there is an alternative  favorable environment to which a  species can move, it may already be  occupied by other species against  which the moving populations  cannot successfully compete. For  example, the predicted northern movement of the  loblolly pine, might not happen if another pine tree species in the northern United  States is a better competitor and prevents the loblolly  pine from surviving in that area. Finally, an environmental change may occur so rapidly that the species  does not have time to evolve new adaptations.
