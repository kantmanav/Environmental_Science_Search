When humans determine which individuals to  breed, typically with a preconceived set of traits in  mind, we call the process evolution by artificial  selection. Artificial selection has produced numerous  breeds of horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens with  traits that humans find useful or aesthetically pleasing.  Most of our modern agricultural crops are also the  result of many years of careful breeding. For example,  starting with a single species of wild mustard, Brassica  oleracea, plant breeders have produced a variety of food crops, including cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels  sprouts, kale, and kohlrabi.
