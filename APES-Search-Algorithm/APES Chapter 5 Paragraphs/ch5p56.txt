Because past changes in environmental conditions  have led to changes in species distributions, it is reasonable to ask whether current and future changes in environmental conditions might also cause changes in species distributions. For example, as the global climate  warms, some areas of the world are expected to receive  less precipitation, while other areas are predicted to  receive more. If our predictions of future environmental changes are correct, and if we have a good understanding of the niche requirements of many species, we  should be able to predict how the distribution of species  will change in the future. North American trees, for  example, are expected to have more northerly distributions with future increases in global temperatures. The loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) is  expected to move from its far southern distribution and  become common throughout the eastern half of the  United States.
