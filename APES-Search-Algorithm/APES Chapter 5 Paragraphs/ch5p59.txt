There are several reasons why species might go  extinct. First, there may be no favorable environment close enough to which they can  move. For example, on the southwest  coast of Australia is a small area of  land that experiences a current climate that supports a woodland/shrubland biome. This biome is surrounded  by a large desert biome to the north  and east and an ocean to the south  and west. If scientists are right in  predicting that the coming century  will bring a hotter and drier climate  to southwestern Australia, then the  unique species of plants that live in  this small biome will have nowhere  to go where they can survive.
